# Labtop-Guide

This is my project in the Artificial Intelligence course at Umm Al-Qura University.

The significance of this idea lies in the growing demand for laptops. Many people face uncertainty when choosing the right laptop and commonly inquire about the "best laptop" available. We particularly emphasize college students as they frequently seek guidance at the start of each semester.
Our objective is to assist individuals in selecting the most suitable laptop that aligns with their specific needs and requirements. Through the implementation of a chatbot, we aim to determine the ideal laptop for each user by asking a series of questions.

This project was built using Prolog.
